# Languages-and-Compilers-2022-CM4106-CW

## Overview
It is the aim of the coursework to create a complete, working compiler for the given language and platform.
The language for which your compiler should work (MiniSquare22) is detailed in a separate document, which fully explains the syntax and semantics of the language. This document can be found on the module’s Moodle page. The target platform is the same Triangle Abstract Machine as was used in the labs. In other words, you must develop a compiler which turns programs written in MiniSquare22 into Triangle Abstract Language code.
You should develop your system in C# and Visual Studio. The compiler must match the overall structure and design of that taught to you in class. You may not use tools to automatically generate the parser or other parts of the compiler. You are free to use or adapt any code given to you in the lab sessions. In fact, I strongly encourage you to use the model solutions to the labs as a starting point and to adapt them for the language used for this coursework.
Your compiler will be assessed by manual inspection of the code. You should therefore adhere to software engineering best practices at all times. I would also advise that you maintain your code using a recognised Version Control System (e.g. GitHub). Use a private repository to ensure the privacy of your code

## Task(s) - format
You should submit a zip archive containing your source code and your report. You should also include any programs that you have compiled to test your work.
The section of your report describing the changes made should be no more than 3000 words. This does not include any words in tables, figures, code snippets, appendices etc. If you can cover everything in fewer words, there is no need to pad the report out. I would recommend however that you try to write around 500 words about each of the components you have implemented; if you write significantly less, you are unlikely to have described all the changes required sufficiently clearly.
There is no word or page limit for the section of the report on testing. Take as many or as few words as you need to describe the testing you conducted.
There is no need to include a cover page, tables of content etc. in the report. As shown in the feedback grids, there is no credit for report presentation, beyond it being clearly written.
Please note: As per the new university regulations, your mark will be reduced by a grade if you exceed the word limit by over 10%. This penalty applies to this whole coursework, not just the report section. (Sorry, nothing I can do about this – its official university rules.)

## How you will be graded
give your final module mark as shown in the grid below. You require an overall mark of D or more to pass this module.
In the feedback grid, the first two rows refer to minor and major issues. Minor issues are things of which are small, of low importance or rarely encountered, whereas major issues are large, significantly impact on the functioning of the compiler and affect many inputs. Generally speaking, a minor issue is one that seems to show a lack of care and attention, and a major issue is one that seems to show a lack of understanding.
